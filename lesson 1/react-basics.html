      // problem with JSX is that our web browser doesn't understand it, we need to transform it into regular JavaScript to do that we can use Babel two steps 1. load the babel 2. give type="text/babel" to our script tag this attribute tells to translate all the code inside the script tag into regular JavaScript

      const button = <button> hello </button>;
      const paragraph = <p> This is a paragraph </p>;
