In React we use className to set the class - React is JS code, JS already has a feature called class so class is a reserved word we cannot use it.
- className in react converted in class in html


flexbox: lets us create flexible layout 
To use flexbox:
1. Create container around element 
2. Add display: flex; to container 
3. Use flexbox features

When a block element (like <div>) is inside a flexbox:
- it no longer takes up the entire line 
- it only takes up as much space as it needs to 

by default, elements inside a flexbox will stretch vertically.

by default body has a default margin of 8px on all sides

by deafult flexbox position all element horizontally (row)

hooks: lets us insert React features into our component : React.useState() is also a hook whih inserts a React feature called state into our component React has others hook we can use and every hook start with the word "use"
useState()
useEffect() : run some code after the component is created or updated 
useRef()
and more ........

put the hook at the top of the componenet  
Hooksshould not be inside anything (function , if statement...)


Best Practice: Give useEffect a dependency array to avoid running to often

React.useRef(); = let us save automatically html element from the component 
Ref is a container with special react features
